          Since our first race in 2014, the focus of the Run For Learning 5K has expanded to become a race that raises funds for licensed, early-education centers (providing preschool and/or kindergarten programs). Proceeds from this annual event will go to teachers at licensed early-education centers in Grayslake, IL and the surrounding area communities through a grant process.
          Funding awards will be evaluated on a competitive basis considering need and benefits
          to youth development. Awardees will be notified by the Run For Learning Board of Directors
          thirty (30) days post race and awards will be handed out at an award ceremony in late October.
